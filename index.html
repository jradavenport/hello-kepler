					  <p>On December 10th/11th, the
					Kepler Space Telescope will be
					pointing at Earth and taking a
					photo for 30 minutes. We want
					to get the entire world to
					wave at Kepler when it takes
					the photo! Scroll down below
					for details about how to find
					where Kepler will be on the
					sky, and when you should wave!

						<h2>About Kepler</h2>
					</header>

					<p>
					  The Kepler Space Telescope
					  is a space observatory
					  launched by NASA to discover
					  Earth-sized planets orbiting
					  other stars. In its 8 years
					  of operation, it has
					  identified over 2500
					  confirmed “exoplanets”
					  around other stars.

					  <p>In 2014, after two major
					  technical failures, Kepler
					  entered a new phase called
					  K2. No longer able to remain
					  pointed at a single point of
					  the sky, Kepler’s camera now
					  slowly drifts across the sky
					  to take images. On December
					  10th, the camera will point
					    towards the Earth, and Earth will take a selfie!
